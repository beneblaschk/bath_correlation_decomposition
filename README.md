# Comparing Different Decomposition Methods to Approximate the Exponential Sum Bath Correlation Function
We study decompositions of the bath correlation function using a Debye and Ohmic
spectral density. These decompositions are based on the Residual theorem to produce
a sum of exponentials. We used the Laurent series expansion to simplify the Bose
function. The residue theorem and the Laurent expansion provide results for Debye
spectral density, however lack accuracy for the Ohmic spectral density.
